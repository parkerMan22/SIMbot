# SIMbot
Unity simulation build project for Prairie STEM and STEMbot for UNO Capstone.

Team Members:
- Joey Gombold
- Parker Jensen
- Rosemary Keenan
- Uy Nyguyen

Description:
 - This simulation is a virtual representation of the Physical STEMbot 2. It has simulated physics and a 3D model of the STEMbot 2. The focus of this simulation is to allow K-12   graders to learn and practice STEM skills with the STEMbot 2 remotely. This will help ease the learning curve if and when they use the real physical STEMbot.

How to run simulation: (A Standalone Executable will be created as our final deliverable of the simulation)
  - Verify Unity Version 2019.4.10f (LTS) is installed.
  - Import project into Unity.
  - Press play button at top to run simulation.

Controls: 
  - Our current control scheme:
    W - Left Wheel Forward
    S - Left Wheel Backward
    I - Right Wheel Forward
    K - Right Wheel Backward
    
    (More control schemes may be added later)
